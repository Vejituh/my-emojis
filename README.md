My Emoji
========

This is a website about using emojis to describe what kind of interest you have.<br />
This was made after finishing the emojis section on scrimbla and wanting to then do it from scratch.<br />
It makes use of **Javascript** to make the website dynamic.<br />
It uses `addEventListener` to see if a user clicks on one of the four buttons and then add/removes emoji from the emoji array.<br />
it then updates the app if just removing an emoji using `updateDisplay` funcion or `checkInput` function to add what is in the input field to the array.<br />
The **styling** was mostly using `text-align` to make sure everything is centered and `flexbox` on the buttons div.
